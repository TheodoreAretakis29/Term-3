    <h2> Nintendo Research and Development 1 </h2>
		<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/36/Gunpei_Yokoi.jpg" class="GW">
		<p> "Who?", you're probably asking, and we don't blame you. Nintendo R&D1 is one of the companies oldest game development teams, intially lead by Gunpei Yokoi (Creator of the GameBoy!). The R&D1 team worked on other titles such as: Tetris, Mario Bros., and Donkey Kong. They knew what they were doing. Unfortunately, in the year of 2005, the R&D1 met a terrible fate and team was defunct, just do to age and the need to spread resources among other projects. Other prominent members include the likes of: Takehiro Izushi, Yoshio Sakamoto, and Hirofumi Matsuoka. The team developed various games throughout its 35-some year life-span but its earliest titles are its most iconic ones. So begins the tale of the creation of Metroid.</p>
    <h2> The Birth of an icon </h2>
		<p> Produced by Gunpei Yokoi, Metroid is the result of the commercial success of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), and its various killer apps, such as The Legend of Zelda, and Super Mario Brothers. It was decided that the team's next big project would be an action game. This was the beginning of what would later be known as "Metroid", a mesh of the words metro and android. Hirokazu Tanaka, also known as, "Hip Tanaka", was a key player in the development of the music used in the game. He described the work environment during the development cycle as "very free." Despite the fact that he was a composer, he was still allowed to give his opinions on other aspects of the game. Now known as a gaming icon, Samus Araan may not have turned out the way we know her. An unnamed employee working on the game asked the other members of staff, "Hey, wouldn't that be kind of cool if it turned out that this person inside the suit was a woman?", and the rest of that is history. This opened mind-set is what helped progress the game's development, and made it into the final product we know and love. </p>
    <h2> An unlikely Influence </h2>
		<p> After many members had gone to go see Ridley Scott's "Alien" (1979), it had been described as being a major influece on the game after the development of the overworld was complete. The staff working on the game were so moved by H.R. Giger's creature design, that they thought it to be more than fitting for the world they were making. </p>
    <h2> A Pioneer of the Genre </h2>
		<p> If you've never heard of the video game genre known as, "Metroid-Vania", then where have you been, these past few years? It's become increasingly popular, with many games trying to pull off the formula that Metroid established many years ago. Similar to The Legend of Zelda, which was meant to follow a "non-linear" route, unlike games such as Mario, Metroid strived to do the same a whilst mixing up this formula even more. Similar to its afformentioned contemporary, the exploration was at the center of it all. It also utilized a system of progression, in which exploration was rewarded. If you truly wanted to beat the game, you needed to search in every crevice. The rewards for this were various upgrades, and weapons, which facilitated the game and allowed for the player to beat it. It gave players a good sense of progressoion and accomplishment. Another trend that the game also helped kickstart was to use games as more of a medium, rather than a simple toy. The goal was to enforce a feeling of desperation and isolation upon the players, and this game most definitely served. </p>
    <h2> More than one ending? </h2>
		<p> Nowadays, you see countless games with multiple endings but did you know that Metroid had 5!? The third, fourth, and fifth ones all ended similarly: with Samus revealing herself to be a woman. The other two endings just resulted in a full armored samus waving off to the player for one last time before the credits role. </p>
