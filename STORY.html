      <h2> The Story thus far... </h2>
      <h3>
      The years is 20X5, and the Space Pirates have attacked a Galactic Federation speace research vessel and acquire a sample of a METROID. These are parasitic creatures that are native to the planet SR388. They're also highly lethal creatures, being able to latch on to any formn of life and drain its energy, killing it. They're a large threat and the The Space Pirates plan to replicate Metroids by exposing them to beta rays and then using them as biological weapons to destroy all living beings that oppose them. The Galactic Federation then begins a hunt for the Space Pirates and the METROID. Eventually, they locate their base on the planet ZEBES and begin an assault. To their surpise, the Space Pirates retaliate, and the Galactic Federation is forced to retreat. Desperate, the Federation decides to send in a single bounty hunter to penetrate deep within  enemy lines and destroy Mother-Brain the biomechanical life-form that controls the Space Pirates' fortress and its defenses. To complete this mission, it is decided that the greatest bounty hunter of all time, Samus Araan will be sent in.
